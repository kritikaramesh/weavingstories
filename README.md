Website Flow:

‚≠ïHome Page: The website starts with the home page titled "Weaving Stories üìΩ‚ù§" where the videos uploaded by the creators can be viewed(here I have used the URL's of videos from youtube). The menu or navigation bar at the top of the page is used to display the links to the sign-in page and the upload page.

‚≠ïSign-in Page: The sign-in page is used for logging into the account of the user. Once an email id and password is given as input the page is directed to the profile page of the user. 

‚≠ïSign-up Page: A link for signing up is also provided at the bottom of the sign-in page which moves to the sign-up page.

‚≠ïMy Profile Page: A sidebar and content format is used to display the links to various pages. The sidebar frame shows the links and the content frame displays the corresponding contentand a return to home page link is provided which moves back to the home page.

‚≠ïUpload Page: A layout for uploading the video from the system is displayed and an upload button is used to upload the video after which the page is directed to complete.html to display a video upload success message.
